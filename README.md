 <h1>hello!</h1>
    <p>this is a base, well not a base, but you can use it as a base for a photography site! i was going to keep this repository private because the code is kind of sloppy because im new to coding, and AI atleast wrote a third of it, so theres a lot of random comments in certain places. but i figured that most people would fix it up themselves so im making it public... if you do use this as a template just note it does have images and stuff because im going to use this for a photography site im building so if you do use this i ask you remove my images i have in it or videos. thankyou and enjoy. (you can just remix the code for your own images and videos and just change the h1 and p tags to put in your own stuff, obviously. i just wanted to note that)
