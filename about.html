    About This Site
</h1>
<p>
 hello! my name is killian, and this is my photography site! I am a boy (brith gender) from the quad cities and I enjoy everything from photography, to video editing, to video games! 
 I was born in 2011 so take what you will with that... ive known how to make websites for awhile now but just started learning css and html! 
 my first website I made I made because a ex boyfriend prompted me too (im bi but lean gay) so i did! if you are not someone I know and you found this site... wow. 
 didnt expect that! but im glad you did find it! this website is just full of goofy images and stuff, you can download them if you want, its not like i get money doing this. 
 below is a video that i believe showcases the quad cities quite well! enjoy!
